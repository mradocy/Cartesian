- Interrupt every 1 or 2 puzzle levels with a more action-y level

- Moving, jumping - horizontal scroll level
- Lasers exist
- Lasers can hurt
- Shoot laser at orb to open door - no scroll level
- Mirrors reflect lasers
- Use mirror to help reach orb
- Lasers can go through glass
- Need to intersect 2 orbs at once to open door
- Vertical scroll level
- Moving lasers
- Use glass to hit 2 orbs
- Use mirror to hit 2 orbs
- Camera movement
	- See orb kinda offscreen, move cursor toward it, reveals something else
- Solution is easy but requires laser to bounce off many mirrors
- Solution is almost vertical shot
- Solution is almost horizontal shot

- Secret area

- Jump spring

- Moving orbs

- Switches

- Room with many mirrors to play around in


- Reflect off door to solve puzzle






- Naive way to hit orb is to also hurt yourself


- Fall into trap (fake walls) that leads to next level.
- Tiny room with glass on right and bottom walls.  Many indestrutable red eyebots stare at the player (red eyebots and red player = transparent laser)
- Escape by hitting breakable wall on left, which leads to more obvious breakable walls. (introduction to the "sand" tile type)
- After playing with sand for a bit, need to go around indestructable blue eyebots (blue eyebot and red player = normal laser)
- 2 paths, but one is blocked by blue eyebot that's impossible to get by.  Take the other path (this path has a red eyebot in the very next room).
- First encounter with blue eyebot that isn't indestructable (back is black).  Destroy it to move on.
- Show off the "death pit": blatently obvious pit that you can't escape from, and need to kill yourself.
- A level or two of trekking through sand tiles
- Get blue laser equip, become blue player.  Now blue eyebots can be passed (blue eyebots and blue player = transparent).
- Find yourself back in the room with 2 paths.  Go to the path blocked by the blue eyebot.



- Thing that splits lasers up

- Use laser to provide power; charge something up -> move something.
	- When it's not getting power, it moves back.





- Reflect own laser off roplate
- Reflect off spring
- Custom roplate with colors on half an edge, etc.
- Use roplates to make a 5 pointed star

- Get colorchip guarded by eyebot in certain direction and continue going in that direction to not get caught.

Level order:

- Third orb hiding behind sand
- Red roplates
- Find red colorchip, then solve with red laser.
- Need to destroy eyebot to get through level
- Open red door to get blue colorchip, then can open blue door.

- Make path through a lot of sand
- Using moving laser to hit 1 of several orbs
- 5 pointed star

- Boss - green laser introduction
	- Need to hit boss in the back

- Need to go to previous level to get colorchip to pass level
- Laser slowly rotates, eventually will hit row of sand tiles and make level unwinnable
- Blast through stuff
- Backtrack through previous levels blasting through it

- Sliders (pushing platforms) introduction
- Reflect lasers of other colors off them
- Can stand on slider
- Can ride on slider
- Set up sliders with one color, switch colors, then fire with other color

- Portals introduction

- Use portal to have Eyebot kill itself
- Need to go back and get certain colorchip



- Another alien boss fight (but with portals?)
- SWORDS
	- To deflect lasers
	- Similar to original design, but:
		- Bigger
		- Colors inverted (back is invulnerable, front isn't)
	- Uses thick laser in final forms

- Rescue Daz.  Daz leaves, and reveals path ahead is full of musgravite.

- Musgravite (non-secret) introduction
	- Shining laser into musgravite splits it up.

- Super Meat Boy reference
- Laser bounces in way that it goes through portal twice
963, 10

- A level where you can "laser skip" to get past it quickly, but only with the wrong color (a color that's useless on the next level)
	- Results in humorous message in the next room

- Need to get 3 musgravite "keys" to open a door
- Backtracking, etc. to get them





- Pre-boss level: Navigate through fake blocks
- Boss: in sparkly cave
	- Boss moves up/down/left/right on a grid
	- When shining laser at boss, it will instantly teleport to another spot on the grid
		- Tiny delay to ensure player isn't also hitting itself
	- goal is to have lasers go through every space on the grid 
	- Phase 1: Simple room with left and right walls all reflective
		- Simply go to a corner and shoot nearly horizontal to take up the entire room
	- Phase 2: Complex room with some musgravite
		- Need to stand in correct spot to shoot in such a way that gets the entire room but not self

- Rescue Rob.
- Get thick laser
- Escape sequence section (with thick laser)
	- Encourages player to be quick, but only last two levels are actually timed.
- Second to last level in this section is timed
	- Running out of time will be the same as a normal death, and level will simply reset like usual
- Last level in this section "continues" where the previous level left off, but will run out of time no matter what.
	- Explosion stuff happens, but will still move on to the next section
- 


- Destroy tiles to make path for other (red) lasers


- Section where use laser to navigate in zero gravity

- Black laser introduction
	- reflects off black, doesn't reflect off anything else.
	- reflects off yourself, so safe to use.

- World wrap introduction
	- Anex boss with world wrap
- Reflect off blue platform
- Platforming section with a low ceiling
- Easy way to complete puzzle be damaging self, elicits funny response from Evri
	- And need to do the real way to have the correct color for the next puzzle anyway.
- Moving orbs?

- Since world wrap works, move between levels with portals from now on.
- Recap of all the mechanics introduced in the game
	1. Easy fake walls puzzle to ease into new area
	2. World wrap intro
	3. World wrap 2
		- Reflect off colored surface, not white surface
	4. Springs
		- Need to reflect blue laser off spring
	5. Oculroids, use to hit orbs
	6. Roplates, chaining together
		- Pick which orbs are done with roplates, and which are done by player
	7. Anex boss fight
		- Only if world wrap works
	8. Sliders
		- Do the "laser skip" bonus dialogue here
			- Skip can only be done with blue laser, but need red laser in next level.
	9. Thick laser
		- Angle thick laser with alt colored roplates?
			- Can possibly kill player
	10. Gems
		- Need to use the short jump at the beginning.
		- Pure platforming?
	
	
		
- Coordinate points highlighted
- Need to mimic an angle to solve puzzle
- Secret challenges reward coordinates that should be filled.

- Math motif?
- Pythagorean theorem puzzle?

- Introduce Evrolian/human hybrids as minor enemies that just walk forward
	- Deals damage upon touching
	- Dies in one hit from laser.  Explodes into small pool of blood
	- Will need to get red colorchip and reflect laser off blood in a puzzle
	
- White laser introduction: reflects off everything except black
	- colors player white, so everything (except black) reflects off player
	- when reflecting off colored tiles, reflected laser is the same color as that tile.
	- can illuminate any color orb -> important to know for final boss
	- these few levels leading up to final boss are easy power trips

- Final boss
	- Uses thick black laser, hits player currently colored white
	- Weakpoint is 4 green eyes
		- Act as 4 orbs; need to make them all glow at the same time
		- eyes can open, close, and rearrange themselves
	- Has hand smash attack where hand flashes white right before it attacks
		- Hand can be reflected off of at that moment, need to do this to defeat final form

Demo:
- Pretend to have the game end at level where the oculroids look at Sibro
	- "Thanks for playing demo, please like share etc."
- But by ignoring that and continuing, get to play a few more levels.
- Alien voice will complement you for not falling for the trick.

ToDo:
x Ending credits
- Ending stats
x Make Midel boss easier
	- Can attack from farther away
x Make Evri boss easier
	- More time in-between attacks to aim.
x Completely redo Gridod 3?
	- Only need 1 gem, but no hints
- The bonus levels
x Fix reticle flicker with colorchip
- Fix Evri's graphics
x Fix aiming glitch with world wrap in Anex rematch
	x If go to other side of screen, stop looking for player
x Second slider level should be fixed so that correct position of slider is at top of path
- SECRETS
	- Ghost that appears briefly and flies away if you're getting through the game fast
	- Only appear in levels with the secret rooms nearby?
	- 3 secret rooms can be accessed by going through fake tiles in 3 levels.
	- Lead to another puzzle.  Solving it will get you one of 3 gems.
	- Unlocks a secret room underneath the "artifactRoom" level.
		- Contains Evoas reference with fourth wall breaking?
		- "THE SONATA NEVER ENDS", trace meloetta trapped scene from the pokemon anime


Tips:
	- Sometimes it's best to think backwards.  Determine how the laser should go through the orbs, then figure out where the laser should start.
	- Puzzle solutions rarely require the usage of every reflectable surface in a room.  It can help to figure out ahead of time which surfaces are too "out of the way" to be used.
	- No solution requires pixel-perfect accuracy or taking damage.  If you find yourself trying to squeeze the laser into awkward angles, you may want to try a different position entirely.
	- Some rooms are expansive, but orbs are usually in close proximity to each other.  You can trust that all the orbs will be on-screen when solving a puzzle.

Cartesian is an innovative new puzzle game starring Sibro, a laser-equipped robot.

An interstellar excavation crew is trapped within the depths of an alien planetoid, so their trusty laser-equipped robot Sibro begins the search for them.
  
Play as a robot exploring the depths of an alien planetoid looking for its lost 




I am a former Pokemon fangame developer whose project was shut down by Nintendo.  Today I release my first "real" game, AMA.


I just wanted a decent game that I could call mine.
  So I made Cartesian.
  
Graphical presentation is overall mediocre, and the game could have more content.

It has a beginning, middle, and end.  There's context for the player's actions.  Responsive, intuitive controls that feel good.
Different levels.  Difficulty progression, 

I had a good friend make the music, but





Before we make an agreement, can I get a taste of how your art will look like?  Try recreating this screenshot https://i.imgur.com/udcMKyC.png.  Just a quick sketch is fine.  Read the first page of this doc for some more direction: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCpDtUScwwy74BkRfZSy6BO1A3ZHf8-GanoMkXaYDpU/edit?usp=sharing


Workload:  This summarizes the above document.
---
Preferred: 6 tilesets, 6 backgrounds.
Bare minimum: 4 tilesets.
Maximum: the entire game.
The workload is flexible.  I'd also like advice from you, as an artist, to what additionally should be done to polish the look of the game.

Deadline:
---
August 23.  Can be extended to August 28 if you think it's not enough.  Unfortunately it won't be long until I can no longer dedicate my time to Cartesian, thus the tight deadline.

Pay: I don't have a budget (and yet I'm still in the hole for spending a lot on legal business stuff).  I still want to grant a fair pay, to ensure a good relationship between us and decent quality work.
---
Here's what I'm thinking:
$150 upfront,
then 30/70 revenue share up to an additional $500 (so max is $650).
So if the graphics can really sell the game, your cut can get more than quadrupled.  This entire offer is flexible, and I don't want you to feel you're getting ripped off.


Todo:
roplate and slider sprites are a bit bigger, fix this
