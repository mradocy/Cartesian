- Interrupt every 1 or 2 puzzle levels with a more action-y level

- Moving, jumping - horizontal scroll level
- Lasers exist
- Lasers can hurt
- Shoot laser at orb to open door - no scroll level
- Mirrors reflect lasers
- Use mirror to help reach orb
- Lasers can go through glass
- Need to intersect 2 orbs at once to open door
- Vertical scroll level
- Moving lasers
- Use glass to hit 2 orbs
- Use mirror to hit 2 orbs
- Camera movement
	- See orb kinda offscreen, move cursor toward it, reveals something else
- Solution is easy but requires laser to bounce off many mirrors
- Solution is almost vertical shot
- Solution is almost horizontal shot

- Secret area

- Jump spring

- Moving orbs

- Switches

- Room with many mirrors to play around in


- Reflect off door to solve puzzle






- Naive way to hit orb is to also hurt yourself


- Fall into trap (fake walls) that leads to next level.
- Tiny room with glass on right and bottom walls.  Many indestrutable red eyebots stare at the player (red eyebots and red player = transparent laser)
- Escape by hitting breakable wall on left, which leads to more obvious breakable walls. (introduction to the "sand" tile type)
- After playing with sand for a bit, need to go around indestructable blue eyebots (blue eyebot and red player = normal laser)
- 2 paths, but one is blocked by blue eyebot that's impossible to get by.  Take the other path (this path has a red eyebot in the very next room).
- First encounter with blue eyebot that isn't indestructable (back is black).  Destroy it to move on.
- Show off the "death pit": blatently obvious pit that you can't escape from, and need to kill yourself.
- A level or two of trekking through sand tiles
- Get blue laser equip, become blue player.  Now blue eyebots can be passed (blue eyebots and blue player = transparent).
- Find yourself back in the room with 2 paths.  Go to the path blocked by the blue eyebot.



- Thing that splits lasers up

- Use laser to provide power; charge something up -> move something.
	- When it's not getting power, it moves back.





- Reflect own laser off roplate
- Reflect off spring
- Custom roplate with colors on half an edge, etc.
- Use roplates to make a 5 pointed star

- Get colorchip guarded by eyebot in certain direction and continue going in that direction to not get caught.

Level order:

- Third orb hiding behind sand
- Red roplates
- Find red colorchip, then solve with red laser.
- Need to destroy eyebot to get through level
- Open red door to get blue colorchip, then can open blue door.

- Make path through a lot of sand
- Using moving laser to hit 1 of several orbs
- 5 pointed star

- Boss - green laser introduction
	- Need to hit boss in the back

- Need to go to previous level to get colorchip to pass level
- Laser slowly rotates, eventually will hit row of sand tiles and make level unwinnable
- Blast through stuff
- Backtrack through previous levels blasting through it

- Sliders (pushing platforms) introduction
- Reflect lasers of other colors off them
- Can stand on slider
- Can ride on slider
- Set up sliders with one color, switch colors, then fire with other color

- Portals introduction

- Use portal to have Eyebot kill itself
- Need to go back and get certain colorchip



- Another alien boss fight (but with portals?)
- SWORDS
	- To deflect lasers
	- Similar to original design, but:
		- Bigger
		- Colors inverted (back is invulnerable, front isn't)
	- Uses thick laser in final forms

- Rescue Daz.  Daz leaves, and reveals path ahead is full of musgravite.

- Musgravite (non-secret) introduction
	- Shining laser into musgravite splits it up.

- Super Meat Boy reference
- Laser bounces in way that it goes through portal twice
963, 10

- A level where you can "laser skip" to get past it quickly, but only with the wrong color (a color that's useless on the next level)
	- Results in humorous message in the next room

- Need to get 3 musgravite "keys" to open a door
- Backtracking, etc. to get them

- Pre-boss level: Navigate through fake blocks
- Boss: in sparkly cave
	- Boss moves up/down/left/right on a grid
	- When shining laser at boss, it will instantly teleport to another spot on the grid
		- Tiny delay to ensure player isn't also hitting itself
	- goal is to have lasers go through every space on the grid 
	- Phase 1: Simple room with left and right walls all reflective
		- Simply go to a corner and shoot nearly horizontal to take up the entire room
	- Phase 2: Complex room with some musgravite
		- Need to stand in correct spot to shoot in such a way that gets the entire room but not self

- Rescue Rob.
- Get thick laser
- Escape sequence section (with thick laser)
	- Encourages player to be quick, but only last two levels are actually timed.
- Second to last level in this section is timed
	- Running out of time will be the same as a normal death, and level will simply reset like usual
- Last level in this section "continues" where the previous level left off, but will run out of time no matter what.
	- Explosion stuff happens, but will still move on to the next section

- Section where use laser to navigate in zero gravity

- Black laser introduction
	- reflects off black, doesn't reflect off anything else.
	- reflects off yourself, so safe to use.

- World wrap introduction
	
- White laser introduction: reflects off everything except black
	- colors player white, so everything (except black) reflects off player
	- when reflecting off colored tiles, reflected laser is the same color as that tile.
	- can illuminate any color orb -> important to know for final boss
	- these few levels leading up to final boss are easy power trips

- Final boss
	- Uses thick black laser, hits player currently colored white
	- Weakpoint is 4 green eyes
		- Act as 4 orbs; need to make them all glow at the same time
		- eyes can open, close, and rearrange themselves
	- Has hand smash attack where hand flashes white right before it attacks
		- Hand can be reflected off of at that moment, need to do this to defeat final form




Tips:
	- Sometimes it's best to think backwards.  Determine how the laser should go through the orbs, then figure out where the laser should start.
	- Puzzle solutions rarely require the usage of every reflectable surface in a room.  It can help to figure out ahead of time which surfaces are too "out of the way" to be used.
	- No solution requires pixel-perfect accuracy or taking damage.  If you find yourself trying to squeeze the laser into awkward angles, you may want to try a different position entirely.
	- Some rooms are expansive, but orbs are usually in close proximity to each other.  You can trust that all the orbs will be on-screen when solving a puzzle.
